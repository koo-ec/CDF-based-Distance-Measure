# ECDF-based Distance Measure
A set of functions for well-known Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)-based distance measure.

Statistical/Probabilistic distance measure algorithms can be categorized into two main categories I) Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)-based and Probability Density Function (PDF)-based. The following algorithms have been implemented:

* Wasserstein Distance
* Anderson-Darling Distance
* Kolmogorov Smirnov Distance
* Cramer von Mises Distance
* Kuiper Distance
* Wasserstein-Anderson-Darling Distance
