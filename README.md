# CDF-based Distance Measure
A set of functions for well-known Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)-based distance measure.

Statistical/Probabilistic distance measure algorithms can be categorized into two main categories I) Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)-based and Probability Density Function (PDF)-based. The following algorithms have been implemented:

Wasserstein Distance
Anderson-Darling Distance
Kolmogorov Smirnov Distance
Cramer von Mises Distance
Kuiper Distance

The code has been converted to MATLAB from "twosamples" library of R (https://github.com/cdowd/twosamples).
